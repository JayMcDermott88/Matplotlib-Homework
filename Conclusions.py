#Difficult to draw conclusions w/out scatter plot. But using the provided sample graph as a template....

#1) There is a slight positive correlation between the drivers and fare. More drivers in a city, the lower the average fare as /
    #the competitve for rides becomes more severe 

#2) Cost is also likely associated with distance and as fare in rural environment is likely associated with distance per ride resulting in higher average fare

#3) Utilization in urban environments directly correspnds with drivers and total rides
